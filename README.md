# KaggleDay1
This is part of the 30 days of ml with kaggle.

 If this is your first time entering a Kaggle competition, regardless of whether you:
  1.have experience with handling large datasets,
  2.haven't done much coding,
  3.are newer to data science, or
  4.are relatively experienced (but are just unfamiliar with Kaggle's platform),
The competition is simple: we want you to use the Titanic passenger data (name, age, price of ticket, etc) to try to predict who will survive and who will die.
