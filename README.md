# KaggleDay1
This is a part of the 30 days of ml with kaggle.

 If this is your first time entering a Kaggle competition, regardless of whether you:
 
  1.have experience with handling large datasets
  
  2.haven't done much coding
  
  3.are newer to data science or
  
  4.are relatively experienced (but are just unfamiliar with Kaggle's platform)
  
  This is a good place to start!
  
The competition is simple: use the Titanic passenger data (name, age, price of ticket, etc) to try to predict who will survive and who will die.

The steps are simple.

1.How to read input .csv files ?

2.Understand the dataset using some simple functions eg . Count() ,shape , Describe() etc.

3.Remove the NaN values from the dataset using .dropna() function.

4.Use Random Forest classifier which create random forest of decision trees .

5.After that we train our data using Random forest classifier.

6.After Training, We test our model on testing data using predict() function.

7.At last , we calculate accuracy of our model.
